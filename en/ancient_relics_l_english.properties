TUTORIAL_ARCHAEOLOGY_VIEW_DESC코0=The Archaeology window shows details of the currently selected §YArchaeology site§!. After progress is made you can still go back and read previous stages by clicking the rune icons.\n\nTo unravel the secrets of a Site, a Scientist must make a §YBreakthrough§! to advance through each of the Site's stages. Scientists with relevant §YTraits and higher Skill§! speed the process of advancing to the next stage, while a higher Difficulty rating of a Site will slow it. Any Scientist who investigates a Site for long enough will amass §YClues§! which will make a Breakthrough more likely.

The Vultaum claimed this device was capable of briefly destabilizing the simulated reality they believed themselves trapped inside, offering a glimpse of the real world.\n\nWhether true or not, when activated the orb makes it possible to manipulate minor aspects of reality in a localized bubble. This effect lasts only for a short while, as the universe seems to quickly right itself again, but if timed right it would give our fleets a decisive advantage.
r_pox_sample코0=Javorian Pox Sample
r_pox_sample_desc코0=A sample of the dreaded Javorian Pox that wiped out the Irassian species. Although harmless to most other life forms, the virus that causes the disease has many unique genetic properties, some of which can actually prolong life in most organics.\n\nThe virus could also be used to create a new strain of the Javorian Pox that can infect non-Irassians.

ancrel.7001.desc코0=The freezing climate of [From.Planet.GetName] has covered the site in thick layers of ice and snow. The desolate location of this site may be a hint of the need for discretion. Whatever took place here, someone wanted to keep it hidden.
ancrel.7002.name코0=Clearing the Tunnels
ancrel.7002.desc코0=The complex consists of several larger underground structures connected with a network of tunnels, many of which are collapsed or blocked by ice. Although ancient, some of the tunnels show clear signs of fire. The damage caused by the fire is major enough to suggest a catastrophic event, or perhaps intentional destruction. One thing is sure, and that is that the purpose of this site seems to be scientific in nature.
ancrel.7004.name코0=Ancient Biological Lab
ancrel.7004.desc코0=Further investigation reveals that the primary purpose of this site seems to have been in the research and development of biological agents. The whole complex seems to have been purged by fire, possibly as the result of the accidental release of one of the biological agents being developed here. With careful and meticulous study of the artifacts that remain, some clues may be found.
ancrel.7005.name코0=Ancient Weapons Lab
ancrel.7005.desc코0=Further investigation reveals that the primary purpose of this site seems to have been in the research and development advanced energy weapons. An accident seems to have triggered a catastrophic explosion, which eradicated most of the site. One data-center seems to be in relatively good condition, perhaps its data will yield some useful insights?
ancrel.7006.name코0=Psionic Guidance
ancrel.7006.1.desc코1=As we touch the Soulstone, we are projected in to a microcosm of the Shroud. We become aware that we are not alone in this swirling twilight realm. There is an entity awaiting us, one immeasurably ancient. A keeper of secrets. $relic_zro_entity_name$, we instinctively know.\n\nHaving passed the test of making contact with it, the entity awaits our questions.
ancrel.7006.2.desc코1=The Soulstone, pulsing with inner light, seems to wordlessly beckon. We touch it, and our minds are drawn in to a pocket dimension of the Shroud, where the enigmatic entity called $relic_zro_entity_name$ awaits.\n\nIt knows things no mortal being could know, and seems willing to share its secrets now that we have reached its sanctum.
ancrel.7006.3.desc코1=Something awaits us inside the Soulstone. $relic_zro_entity_name$. It's been waiting for us since before we were alive.\n\nTouching the stone ushers us in to the intangible place where it dwells. Alone for ages with only its own thoughts for company, the entity seems eager to answer our questions using all its arcane wisdom, although whether it does this to help, or for mere sport, is a mystery.
ancrel.7006.a코0=Ask $relic_zro_entity_name$ to share an insight
ancrel.7006.b코0=Ask $relic_zro_entity_name$ about matters martial
ancrel.7006.c코0=Ask $relic_zro_entity_name$ about matters of state
ancrel.7007.name코0=$r_galaxy$
ancrel.7007.desc코1=Time flows faster inside the miniature galaxy, and by carefully observing its denizens we are able to learn much when comes to advanced technologies.

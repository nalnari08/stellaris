pc_alpine코0=Alpine World
pc_alpine_desc코0=Mountainous world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Snow covers the mountaintops and frozen-over lakes dot the valleys. While the planet experiences minimal seasonal variations, the still-liquid water beneath the frozen surface of the lakes is enough to sustain some hardy vegetation.
pc_savannah코0=Savanna World
pc_savannah_desc코0=Rocky world dominated by dry, arid plains covered by a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The small hydrosphere allows for brief wet seasons, but aside from a few ubiquitous grasses vegetation is largely concentrated around shallow oases.

pc_pulsar코0=Pulsar
pc_pulsar_desc코0=Pulsars are highly magnetized neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation. As the star rotates, the radiation beam is only visible when it is pointing directly at the observer. This results in a very precise interval of pulses, which sometimes is so exact that it can be used to measure the passage of time with extreme accuracy.

citizenship_limited_tooltip코0=Pops are free, but may not engage politically and the species can not produce §HLeaders§!.
citizenship_limited_tooltip_delayed코0=§LThey have yet to prove themselves worthy of all rights afforded to others. Perhaps they never will.§!
citizenship_slavery코0=Slaves
citizenship_slavery_tooltip코0=All Pops of this species will be enslaved. Slaves have lower §HConsumer Good Use§! than free Pops.
citizenship_slavery_tooltip_delayed코0=§LFreedom is an illusion. For some this truth is more tangible than it is for others.§!
citizenship_purge코0=Undesirables
citizenship_purge_tooltip코0=All Pops of this species will be systematically Purged. Pops subject to Purging (except §HNeutering§!) have zero §HConsumer Goods Use§!.

slavery_normal_tooltip_delayed코0=§LChattel Slavery is the most common form of slavery in the galaxy. Whether for life or a limited time, unrestricted access to the labor of others is in some parts seen as a privilege with numerous counter-duties attached, and elsewhere considered a self-evident prerequisite for a functioning society.§!
slavery_domestic코0=Domestic Servitude
slavery_domestic_tooltip코0=§HDomestic Servants§! increase the £happiness §HHappiness§! of free Pops but are less productive than other slaves or even free Pops.
slavery_domestic_tooltip_delayed코0=§LDomestic servants spend much of their time tending to the needs of free Pops - some are assigned to individual domiciles, while others tend to public spaces. The split in their duties reduces their "hard" resource output, but the quality of life gains for free Pops frequently outweigh this drawback.§!

living_standard_chemical_bliss_tooltip코0=Entertainment media is made freely available as a drug regimen induces a euphoric stupor. The Pops are happy, but useless.

purge_normal_tooltip_delayed코0=§LThe extermination squads are efficient. The dissolution of entire populations naturally takes time, but they get the job done.§!
purge_displacement코0=Displacement
purge_displacement_tooltip코0=Affected Pops are expelled from our nation over time, left to find refuge outside our borders.
purge_displacement_tooltip_delayed코0=§LIt's not that we drive them from their homes. Their homes are simply no longer theirs.§!

# Star Classes
####################################
sc_b코0=§HClass B Star§!
sc_b_desc코0=§LThe large class B main-sequence stars are very bright and blue. Although somewhat rare, the luminosity of these stars make them some of the most visible to the naked eye.§!
sc_a코0=§HClass A Star§!
sc_a_desc코0=§LThese relatively young white or bluish-white main-sequence stars are typically among the most visible to the naked eye. They are large and rotate very quickly, but will eventually evolve into slower and cooler red giants.§!
sc_f코0=§HClass F Star§!
sc_f_desc코0=§LF-type stars are fairly large and often referred to as yellow-white dwarves. Although they often emit significant amounts of UV radiation, their wide habitable zones have a good chance of supporting life-bearing worlds.§!
sc_g코0=§HClass G Star§!
sc_g_desc코0=§LOften referred to as yellow dwarves, G-type stars actually range in color from white to slightly yellow. Main-sequence stars fuse hydrogen for roughly 10 billion years before they expand and become red giants. Although their lifespans are shorter than K-type stars, worlds inside the habitable zone of a G star often enjoy optimal conditions for the development of life.§!
sc_k코0=§HClass K Star§!
sc_k_desc코0=§LThese main-sequence stars, sometimes referred to as orange dwarves, are a fairly common sight. They are stable on the main-sequence for up to 30 billion years, meaning that worlds orbiting a K-type star have a longer than average window to evolve life.§!
sc_m코0=§HClass M Star§!
sc_m_desc코0=§LThe most common stars in the universe, often referred to as red dwarves. Their low luminosity means they are difficult to observe with the naked eye from afar. Although they typically have an extremely long lifespan, red dwarves emit almost no UV light resulting in unfavorable conditions for most forms of life.§!
sc_black_hole코0=§HBlack Hole§!
sc_black_hole_desc코0=§LTypically formed as a result of the collapse of a very massive star at the end of its life cycle, black holes have extremely strong gravity fields that prevent anything - including light - from escaping once the event horizon has been crossed.§!
sc_neutron_star코0=§HNeutron Star§!
sc_neutron_star_desc코0=§LThese incredibly dense stellar remnants are sometimes created when a massive star suffers a rapid collapse and explodes in a supernova. Although their diameter is typically as little as ten kilometers, their mass is many times greater than an average G-type star.§!
sc_pulsar코0=§HPulsar§!
sc_pulsar_desc코0=§LPulsars are highly magnetized neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation. As the star rotates, the radiation beam is only visible when it is pointing directly at the observer. This results in a very precise interval of pulses, which sometimes is so exact that it can be used to measure the passage of time with extreme accuracy.§!

army_attachment_exploding_slave_collars_desc코0=§LThese collars are attached to slaves (placement depends on anatomy), and can be detonated by remote signal if they act against the wishes of their masters. Shrewd commanders have been known to detonate collars during close quarters fighting to inflict damage on enemy forces.§!
army_attachment_slaver_raiding_teams코0=Slave Raiding Teams
army_attachment_slaver_raiding_teams_desc코0=§LThese slaver teams, many consisting of former slaves themselves, use hit-and-run attacks on enemy rear areas for the purpose of capturing more slaves. After some rapid conditioning, the captured slaves are then thrown into circulation on the battlefield against their former comrades.§!
army_attachment_commissar_squads코0=Commissar Squads
army_attachment_commissar_squads_desc코0=§LEnforcing discipline in an army of slaves is a monumental task, but these squads of hardened commissars have turned it into an art. Decimation and other harsh disciplinary actions are used to ensure the slaves fear the ire of the commissars more than the enemy.§!
army_attachment_clone_suicide_brigade코0=Clone Suicide Brigade
army_attachment_clone_suicide_brigade_desc코0=§LClones bred with a single overriding purpose in mind - to seek out concentrations of enemy forces, dive into their midst and detonate the explosives strapped onto their bodies. These random acts of terror often cause considerable damage to enemy morale.§!
army_attachment_clone_commandos코0=Clone Commandos
army_attachment_clone_commandos_desc코0=§LThese vat-grown killers are expensive to produce, but the extreme conditioning and training they are subjected to turn them into very capable soldiers. They are more independent-minded than normal clones, and some models have been known to develop eccentric quirks.§!
army_attachment_hypnotic_training_regimen코0=Hypnotic Training Regimen
army_attachment_hypnotic_training_regimen_desc코0=§LThe clone soldiers have been put through an extensive regimen of hypnotic training, beyond to their normal conditioning. This further improves combat efficiency, although units that far exceed their battlefield lifetime expectancy are sometimes prone to psychotic breakdowns.§!
army_attachment_psi_shield_specialists코0=PSI-Shield Specialists
army_attachment_psi_shield_specialists_desc코0=§LOperatives that have been specifically trained to project powerful psionic shields over friendly positions on the battlefield. These shields can be every bit as potent as conventional energy force fields, but maintaining them requires a lot of concentration.§!
army_attachment_telekinetic_specialists코0=Telekinetic Specialists
army_attachment_telekinetic_specialists_desc코0=§LPsionic specialists who have shown a particular talent for manipulating their environment. In the right conditions, they are capable of hurling enemy soldiers and vehicles into the air, or plucking aircraft from the sky and slamming them into the ground.§!
army_attachment_class_a_psi_operative코0=Class-A PSI Operative
army_attachment_class_a_psi_operative_desc코0=§LRare individuals wielding tremendous psionic power, usually with the unfortunate side-effect of fraying their minds. They are extremely dangerous both to themselves and their environment, but can be a formidable weapon when their destructive energies are directed towards the enemy.§!
army_attachment_infestation_brood코0=Infestation Brood
army_attachment_infestation_brood_desc코0=§LWhen unleashed, these violent parasitic creatures immediately seek out hosts to implant with their offspring. This allows them to breed at an exponential rate, and entire cities can be wiped out in a matter of days. Needless to say, their presence does not have a positive effect on enemy morale.§!
army_attachment_brood_coordinator코0=Brood Coordinator
army_attachment_brood_coordinator_desc코0=§LThis massive, slug-like creature is kept behind the front lines to improve the coordination of the ravenous creatures in a xenomorph army. It uses low-level psionic signals to communicate with the horde, and a complaint unrelated to its odor is that its handlers often suffer from severe headaches.§!
army_attachment_battle_worms코0=Battle Worms
army_attachment_battle_worms_desc코0=§LThese colossal annelids have been genetically engineered to burrow through the ground, bypassing enemy defenses and allowing smaller creatures to follow their wake. The tunnels they dig also provide excellent shelter from orbital bombardment.§!
army_attachment_raptor_flocks코0=Raptor Flocks
army_attachment_raptor_flocks_desc코0=§LLarge flying predators capable of reaching supersonic speeds for limited periods. They attack in flocks, firing streams of hardened spines that are capable of penetrating most armor. Any aircraft venturing into the atmosphere above a nest of these creatures is at risk of attack.§!
army_attachment_advanced_power_armor코0=Advanced Power Armor
army_attachment_advanced_power_armor_desc코0=§LThese expensive suits of armor are almost as expensive to produce as the gene warriors themselves. They further augment the already considerable strength of their users, and jet packs offer increased mobility. To operate, the suit requires its wearer to establish a nerve-link.§!
army_attachment_environmental_augmentations코0=Environmental Augmentations
army_attachment_environmental_augmentations_desc코0=§LFurther improvements to the lungs and immune systems enable the gene warriors to function without impairment in hostile environments - even the vacuum of space for limited periods.§!
army_attachment_cybernetic_replacements코0=Cybernetic Replacements
army_attachment_cybernetic_replacements_desc코0=§LOrgans and limbs damaged or lost in battle are replaced with advanced cybernetic implants, allowing crippled warriors to remain in service even after suffering grievous injuries.§!

START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_DESPOTIC_EMPIRE코0=The early chaotic periods of our history saw many nation states vying with each other for power, until we were at last united under the strongest of these. Only when guided by a single vision could we reach our full potential, and an era of stability and scientific progress followed.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_OLIGARCHY코0=As scientific knowledge increased and new outposts were founded across our world, trade flourished and tied the various nation states together until they became a single entity. Power rested with the merchant princes, the true architects of our achievements as a civilization.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_REPRESENTATIVE_DEMOCRACY코0=We were driven forward by steady scientific progress, and armed conflicts between nation states became increasingly rare. The framework for a global democratic government was eventually laid, and when the last holdouts voluntarily joined we stood united as a single nation.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_THEOCRATIC_MONARCHY코0=Many false prophets took it upon themselves to offer spiritual guidance to our people as we advanced through the ages, but the true faith prevailed. The last heathen strongholds were vanquished after several bloody crusades, uniting us under the holy will of a single divine leader.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_THEOCRATIC_OLIGARCHY코0=As we progressed through the technological ages, there were many religions among our people that contended with each other for followers. Gradually, sometimes peacefully and sometimes less so, the true faith found its way to all corners of our world and the faithful were united under a single universal church.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_THEOCRATIC_REPUBLIC코0=Great achievements were made, both in the advancement of science and on the spiritual plane as we sought to expand our understanding of the universe and the role we play in it. A council of our most learned priests was convened to advise our elected leaders, a tradition that continues to this day.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_STAR_EMPIRE코0=Technological progress has been swift, but as our numbers grew the civilian population became increasingly restless. With our world on the brink of anarchy, the military stepped in to restore the rule of law. A new order was established to safeguard our nation from all threats, both external and internal.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MILITARY_REPUBLIC코0=As we advanced through the ages, many of our earliest nation states suffered greatly from the constant power struggles between the military and civilian institutions that governed society. A compromise was reached in a new form of government, where one could not exist without the other.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MARTIAL_EMPIRE코0=Countless nation states formed as we advanced through the technological ages, warring against each other until only one remained. Although the fighting was often brutal, those who survived nurtured a martial tradition that has prevailed to this day.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_ASSEMBLY_OF_CLANS코0=As we advanced through the ages, many of our earliest nation states suffered greatly from the constant power struggles between the military and civilian institutions that governed society. A compromise was reached in a new form of government, where one could not exist without the other.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_CITIZEN_STRATOCRACY코0=Many wars were fought between our early nation states, and those who could not defend themselves disappeared or were absorbed by stronger neighbors. These endless wars fostered a strong martial tradition, and to this day full citizenship is reserved for those who have proved willing to sacrifice themselves in defense of the state.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_IRENIC_MONARCHY코0=The violent periods of our history reached a peaceful conclusion when we were united under a single monarch for the first time. An unbroken era of peace and prosperity followed, which has lasted to this day.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_IRENIC_BUREAUCRACY코0=Unfortunately, our undisciplined minds were still prone to emotional outbursts that could sometimes lead to violence. As weapons became more deadly with each passing technological age, a complex system of government was devised to protect our citizens from harmful elements - including themselves.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MORAL_DEMOCRACY코0=As we advanced through the technological ages, we also matured as a species. The violent and base impulses we inherited from our ancestors were done away with, and a global government was formed on the principles of peaceful coexistence.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_CELESTIAL_EMPIRE코0=There was much darkness and sorrow in the early ages, as our people frequently gave in to their base instincts and turned upon one another. Then, suddenly, the clouds parted and a light from the heavens appeared, shining down upon the one who would become our first Celestial monarch. We were united at last.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_DESPOTIC_HEGEMONY코0=Despite our rapid progression through the technological ages, as a species we were fragmented and inefficient. A new system emerged during these chaotic times that delivered us from superstitious beliefs and brought order to society. Some resisted this change out of irrational fear, but after several pacification wars they too became productive components of a greater whole.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_EXECUTIVE_COMMITTEE코0=The chaotic periods of our early history eventually gave rise to a new society which unified our people as none had done before. Succumbing neither to tyranny nor to the ignorance of the masses, our society evolved into one that is ruled fairly by a just and unbiased bureaucratic machine.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_DIRECT_DEMOCRACY코0=As our technology progressed to a level that allowed for instantaneous communications, our inefficient nation states merged together to form a true democracy, with every citizen having a say in important decisions.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_ILLUMINATED_AUTOCRACY코0=The birth of science and rational thought necessitated the removal of those political leaders who impeded technological progress through ignorance, superstition, sheer stupidity or a combination of the three. Instead, a single qualified ruler from the scientific community would be chosen to guide our developing nation into the future.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_SCIENCE_DIRECTORATE코0=Through scientific progress, we have managed to stamp out the superstitions that ruled the minds of our ancestors. As reason and rational thought spread among our people, the inefficient nation states that we had until then organized ourselves into were disbanded, and a council of our most accomplished scientists was gathered to rule in their stead.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_RATIONAL_CONSENSUS코0=Alas, our ancestors were victims of ignorance and superstition in the early eras. This dark period of our history lasted until science and rationality were firmly established as the guiding principles of our society. A new democratic system of government was introduced where important decisions were made by consensus.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MEGACORPORATION코0=In the early days, our people were governed by primitive feudal realms and inefficient nation states. Gradually, as global trade increased, the influence of private corporations grew steadily until their power far surpassed the governments that once tried to regulate them. After a series of mergers and violent take-overs during the destructive Corporate Wars, a single Megacorporation eventually emerged as the sole ruling body of our homeworld.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_PURIFIER코0=There were other [GetAdj] cultures, once, diluting the purity of our society with their weaknesses. These renegades were dealt with, one after the other, until our world had been utterly cleansed of their taint. Today only the pure remain.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_HIVE_MIND코0=And so, at the dawn of time, we awoke. The Mind studied our surroundings on [GetHomeWorldName] with a multitude of eyes. We moved as one, building shelters for the drones, developing industry, researching new technologies and harnessing the resources of the land.\n\nSoon, we had grown to encompass the entire world. A small number of autonomous drones were created to serve as independent agents. These more formidable drones had the capacity for limited free thought, but were still as inexorably bound to the will of the Mind as any of its other instruments.\n\nAs we achieved complete dominion over [GetHomeWorldName], the Mind became aware of other worlds, orbiting other suns. The most intelligent of our autonomous drones devised new methods of travel, enabling us to cross the vast distances between the stars. The [GetName] will soon grow.
START_SCREEN_PART_THREE_WARP코0=Now, after the successful creation of several experimental subspace fields, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished development of the first warp drives. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp!
START_SCREEN_PART_THREE_HYPERSPACE코0=Now, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished development of the first hyper drives. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp!
START_SCREEN_PART_THREE_WORMHOLES코0=Now, after the successful creation of artificial subspace wormholes, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished construction of the first Wormhole Station at the edge of our system. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp!
START_SCREEN_UNE코0=Much has happened since modern Humans first emerged in Africa some 200,000 years ago. Our kind spread rapidly across most of the globe and soon the first civilizations took form.\n\nScientific progress has been swift, though not without cost. Wars claimed millions of lives even before the atom was tamed, and the turmoil of the 21st century saw the mandate of the United Nations gradually expanded in an effort to create stability. By the early 22nd century the supranational organization had become a de facto world government.\n\nThough some still resent the power wielded by the UN, as evidenced during the Mauritanian Police Action of '88, few can deny the technological breakthroughs that have come out of its sponsored research programs. With the recent completion of the first true starships, mankind is about to embark on a new era of space exploration!
START_SCREEN_CM코0=More than a century has passed since the great ark ship Chrysanthemum carried a quarter million of our ancestors from distant Earth to the garden world we have come to know as [GetHomeWorldName]. After a long and perilous journey, the colonists rejoiced when they first saw sunlight again - albeit from a foreign star.\n\nThe early years were difficult. Citizen militias were formed to fight off the lethal alien wildlife that we found ourselves sharing our new home with, and cultivating the terrestrial crops that had been brought proved harder than imagined. Yet for each challenge overcome, we became stronger.\n\nOnce this new world had been tamed, our numbers grew exponentially. The last few decades have seen great leaps in technology, and we are now - finally - ready to reach out and reclaim the stars from whence we came!

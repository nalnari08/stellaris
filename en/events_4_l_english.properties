anomaly.6000.name코0=Rogue Moon
# "parent planet" and "its primary", pending PARENTPLANET loc key implementation
anomaly.6000.desc코0=[From.GetName] does not appear to be made up of a similar material to its parent planet, indicating that is was once a rogue planetoid which has been caught in its primary's gravity well. Further study may reveal where it originally came from.
anomaly.6001.desc코0=[From.GetName] contains a base!
anomaly.6002.name코0=Hollow Planet
anomaly.6002.desc코1=After extensive study, we have concluded that [From.GetName] is an artificial construct. Their working theory is that [From.GetName] was originally a fairly normal asteroid belt which was somehow crushed together to gather the required materials and then shaped into a hollow sphere.
anomaly.6003.desc코1=Much to our surprise, [From.GetName] appears to have begun life as a normal planet, but it has at some point been entirely hollowed out using an unknown mining technique which has left [From.GetName] a mere empty shell.
anomaly.6004.name코0=Strong Magnetic Field
anomaly.6004.desc코0=Initial scanning revealed little but that [From.GetName] has an unusually strong magnetic field surrounding it. This interfered with detailed scans until the [Root.GetName] moved in for a closer look. The field seems to be caused by the high density of metallic ores found the planet's crust, which will likely be a boon to local mining endeavors.
anomaly.6005.name코0=Abnormal Conditions
anomaly.6005.desc코0=Our scans are showing that [From.GetName] is rather unusual, a closer look is required.
anomaly.6006.name코0=Abnormal Conditions
anomaly.6006.desc코0=Our scan of [From.GetName] is complete, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has prepared a report on the unusual conditions found here.
anomaly.6006.a코0=Report, [Root.GetLeaderName].
anomaly.6007.name코0=Mineral Rich
anomaly.6007.desc코0=[From.From.GetName] has an abundance of easily accessible minerals in this planet's crust, which should make mining here a lucrative business.
anomaly.6008.desc코0=[From.From.GetName] suffers from unstable weather patterns, with violent storms frequently appearing out of nowhere to wreak havoc on the surface. Wind farms would likely be able to supply bountiful energy here.
anomaly.6009.desc코0=[From.From.GetName] has evolved extremely hostile fauna, and the surface is rife with lethal predators waiting to ambush their next meal. Their biology offers great research opportunities.
anomaly.6010.desc코0=Although habitable, [From.From.GetName] has an almost non-existent magnetic field that offers little protection against cosmic radiation.
anomaly.6011.desc코0=[From.From.GetName] has an abnormally high magnetic field, caused by rich deposits of metallic ore. This will interfere with many of our instruments and computers, but the rich mining yield should more than make up for it.
anomaly.6012.desc코0=[From.From.GetName] has very unstable plate tectonics and is prone to massive earthquakes and volcanic activity. Deposits of valuable minerals are frequently exposed on the surface.
anomaly.6013.desc코0=[From.From.GetName] is tidally locked around its star, meaning that one side always has daylight while the other is locked in eternal darkness. If life exists here, it is likely limited to the twilight regions where the two sides meet.
anomaly.6014.desc코0=It seems [From.From.GetName] was once a gas giant, but its proximity to its star has burned away the thick atmosphere. All that remains now is a super-dense and mineral rich metallic core.
anomaly.6015.desc코0=The orbital path [From.From.GetName] takes around its star is littered with small asteroids, meteors, and comet swarms. Large impacts on the surface occur at an alarming frequency, often leaving behind valuable mineral deposits.
anomaly.6016.desc코0=[From.From.GetName] has an unusually large amount of natural satellites. Hundreds of small moons and moonlets orbit the planet, many possessing valuable mineral deposits.
anomaly.6017.desc코0=It appears that [From.From.GetName] been formed mostly out of carbon, and contains little oxygen. Not only is it rich in minerals, but volcanic eruptions frequently bring diamonds from the interior to the surface.
anomaly.6018.desc코0=Spectacular electrical storms wrack [From.From.GetName]'s atmosphere on a semi-regular basis. While it will likely not be much fun for the inhabitants, there are ample research opportunities here.
anomaly.6019.desc코0=[From.From.GetName] has an unusually low density, and therefore much lower gravity than most planets of comparable size.
anomaly.6020.desc코0=[From.From.GetName] is unusually dense, and so has uncomfortably high gravity. However, the amount of heavy metals present should greatly aid Physics research.
anomaly.6021.desc코0=[From.From.GetName] has either been artificially created or was somehow hollowed out. How or why we do not know, but investigating it promises to be fascinating.
anomaly.6022.desc코0=The cornucopia of easily accessible minerals in [From.From.GetName]'s crust provides a truly staggering opportunity for mining.
anomaly.6023.desc코0=It is unknown if [From.From.GetName] was simply formed this way, or if some unknown race once stripped it of resources. However, we do know that there are very few minerals to be found here.
anomaly.6024.desc코0=The lifeforms of [From.From.GetName] are built on a massive scale and can be incredibly dangerous even without meaning any harm. The less said about the gargantuan predators of this world the better, but they do represent a treasure trove of research data if any scientists are brave enough to try.
anomaly.6025.desc코0=Perhaps [From.From.GetName] once had a moon which was destroyed in some calamity, or perhaps its orbital debris never fully coalesced in the first place. Whatever the cause, this planet is surrounded by a belt of small asteroids.
anomaly.6026.desc코0=The scenery of [From.From.GetName] is simply beautiful, anyone living on this planet will be constantly finding new wonders to behold.
anomaly.6027.desc코0=Something in the air of [From.From.GetName] seems to put people in the mood to... reproduce. Needless to say, this rather made the ground-based part of the survey somewhat awkward.
anomaly.6028.desc코0=The air of [From.From.GetName] contains a natural hallucinogen. While this will keep people happy, and indeed it seems to aid the visualization of some of the more esoteric Physics problems, it will also distract people from other work.
anomaly.6029.desc코0=Life thrives on [From.From.GetName], the fauna is plentiful and the flora grows rapidly.
anomaly.6030.desc코0=Life struggles to survive on [From.From.GetName], and while some clings to a tenacious existence it is anemic and sickly.
anomaly.6031.desc코0=Some long-ago calamity rendered [From.From.GetName] rather heavily irradiated. With the passage of time it has become marginally habitable again, but so far little can grow here.
anomaly.6660.desc.start코1=As our Science Ship scans the surface of [From.GetName] it becomes quite clear that we have found something out of the ordinary.

anomaly.6660.desc.weather코1=$anomaly.6660.desc.start$ Strong storms ravage the [From.GetPlanetMoon] constantly, which can aid our resources and research but will be an obstacle for our population.\n\n$anomaly.6660.desc.end$
anomaly.6660.desc.magnetic코2=$anomaly.6660.desc.start$ The [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s magnetic field is way out of sync with what is expected of its type.\n\n$anomaly.6660.desc.end$
anomaly.6660.desc.tectonic코0=$anomaly.6660.desc.start$ The unstable nature of the [From.GetPlanetMoon] makes earthquakes and volcanic eruptions commonplace.\n\n$anomaly.6660.desc.end$
anomaly.6660.desc.tidal코0=$anomaly.6660.desc.start$ The [From.GetPlanetMoon] is locked in its rotation around the sun, meaning constant nights and days on each side of it. The habitability situation is less than ideal.\n\n$anomaly.6660.desc.end$
anomaly.6660.desc.impacts코1=$anomaly.6660.desc.start$ The [Root.GetPlanetMoon] is harrowed by constant meteorite showers, bombarding its surface with enormous projectiles.\n\n$anomaly.6660.desc.end$
anomaly.6660.desc.gravity코0=$anomaly.6660.desc.start$ The gravity on the planet is far from ideal to accommodate our potential settlers.\n\n$anomaly.6660.desc.end$
anomaly.6660.desc.wildlife코0=$anomaly.6660.desc.start$ Animals found on this planet seem hostile, and will make it harder to colonize.\n\n$anomaly.6660.desc.end$
anomaly.6660.desc.titan코0=$anomaly.6660.desc.start$ The planet is host to massive lifeforms that might be dangerous to interact with.\n\n$anomaly.6660.desc.end$
anomaly.6660.desc.resources코0=$anomaly.6660.desc.start$ Its composition and history provides it with extra materials that we should take opportunity to gather.\n\n$anomaly.6660.desc.end$
anomaly.6660.desc.beauty코3=$anomaly.6660.desc.start$ The [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s natural beauty can make anyone gape in awe. Life here would be pleasant, for physiologically compatible lifeforms.\n\n$anomaly.6660.desc.end$
anomaly.6660.desc.atmosphere코0=$anomaly.6660.desc.start$ The atmosphere contains special gases that could affect our population, so we should be wary.\n\n$anomaly.6660.desc.end$
anomaly.6660.desc.lush코0=$anomaly.6660.desc.start$ The fauna has no trouble to flourish, and could provide ample opportunity to harvest much needed resources.\n\n$anomaly.6660.desc.end$
anomaly.6660.desc.terrible코0=$anomaly.6660.desc.start$ The environment is harsh and bleak, and would not serve as an optimal settlement site.\n\n$anomaly.6660.desc.end$
anomaly.6660.desc.end코0=We will surely come across even more irregularities like this as we survey new planets, and should not underestimate their impact on our expansion.
anomaly.6660.a.tooltip코0=A Planet Modifier appears on [From.GetName].

# Colony Events
####################################
colony_mod.1.name코0=What Happened Here?
colony_mod.1.desc코0=While it's obvious that some past calamity released a vast amount of radiation on [Root.GetName], it's not obvious what caused it. This mystery is now bothering more and more of the colonists who have made [Root.GetName] their home. After all, if we don't know how this happened, what is to say it could not happen again?
colony_mod.1.a코0=Let's get to the bottom of this!
colony_mod.2.name코0=Titanic Life
colony_mod.2.desc코0=The native life of [Root.GetName] is built on an epic scale, far larger than anyone previously thought was possible for biological life. The question now of the minds of our researchers is "What is their secret, and can we benefit from it?" Proposals to study the native life in greater detail are flooding in.
colony_mod.2.a코0=Proceed with the study.
colony_mod.2.b코0=No, leave the giants alone.
colony_mod.2.c코0=Ensure that the research does no harm.
colony_mod.2.d코0=Study them? Harvest them and see if anything is useful!
colony_mod.3.name코0=Earthquake!
colony_mod.3.desc코0=The unstable tectonic plates of [Root.GetName] have just violently shifted once again. Reports on the damage to the colony are just starting to arrive.
colony_mod.3.a코0=Let us hear it.
colony_mod.4.name코0=Comet Sighted Through Belt
colony_mod.4.desc코0=The population of [Root.GetName] are currently witnessing a spectacular sight. A comet is passing through [Root.GetName]'s asteroid belt and the effect is being described as "breathtaking."
colony_mod.4.a코0=Keep looking at the sky!
colony_mod.5.name코0=Crackdown
colony_mod.5.desc코1=While it cannot be denied that the intoxicating effects of [Root.GetName]'s atmosphere are enjoyable, and even helpful in some cases, there is pressure from the more conservative parts of the [Root.Owner.GetName] to crack down on the possibly addictive gases.
colony_mod.5.a코1=Shut it down!
colony_mod.5.b코0=No, leave [Root.GetName] as it is.
colony_mod.6.name코0=Bombardment
colony_mod.6.desc코0=After a thorough investigation, we have come to an uncomfortable conclusion: [Root.GetName] was the site of an ancient genocide. As far as we can determine, the native population of [Root.GetName] was on the verge of becoming a space-faring race when a far more advanced race suddenly entered the System, bombarded [Root.GetName] from orbit, and left again, leaving the few survivors doomed to extinction.
colony_mod.6.a코0=Study the impact sites for details of the weapons used.
colony_mod.7.name코0=Interstellar War
colony_mod.7.desc코0=After a thorough investigation, we have come to an uncomfortable conclusion: [Root.GetName] was a casualty in some forgotten war. Who lived here and who they fought is unknown, but it is clear that they were wiped out following an extra-solar invasion force entering the system and the ensuring battle for the planet. While this is a chilling realization, we can at least be reasonably sure that it is unlikely to happen again.
colony_mod.7.a코0=Study what remains of the battlefields.
colony_mod.8.name코0=Racial Suicide
colony_mod.8.desc코0=The tragic history of [Root.GetName] has been uncovered. Long ago, it seems that [Root.GetName] was dominated by two competing superpowers. At some point war broke out between them and the conflict escalated until all advanced life on [Root.GetName] was eliminated by excessive use of nuclear weapons.
colony_mod.8.a코0=What could drive people to such a fate?
colony_mod.9.name코0=We just don't know.
colony_mod.9.desc코0=Despite extensive research into the history of [Root.GetName] we just don't know what happened here. The past remains a mystery.
colony_mod.9.a코0=Troubling.
colony_mod.10.name코1=Crackdown
colony_mod.10.desc코1=The atmosphere of [Root.GetName] has been cleansed of its intoxicating elements!
colony_mod.11.name코1=Crackdown: Breakthrough
colony_mod.11.desc코1=The atmosphere of [Root.GetName] has been filtered to greatly reduce the effects of the hallucinogen.
hallucinogen_update_tooltip코0=Ahh, fresh air!
colony_mod.12.name코1=Asteroid Impacts
colony_mod.12.desc코1=Once again, [Root.GetName] has been pummeled by falling Asteroids, and this time part of our colony has been destroyed. Needless to say, the local population is not happy.
colony_mod.12.a코1=They knew the risks.
colony_mod.12.b코0=Something must be done!
colony_mod.13.name코1=Asteroid Defense System
colony_mod.13.desc코1=A combination of extra-sturdy construction techniques and automated defenses should keep the people of [Root.GetName] safe from further asteroid impacts.
irradiated_planet_tooltip코0=The investigation starts...
colony_mod.14.name코1=Space Bounty
colony_mod.14.desc코1=While an Asteroid falling on your planet can be nerve-wracking, [Root.GetName] has been rather fortunate. No harm has befallen the colony.
colony_mod.14.a코0=Our people will endure this harsh environment.
colony_mod.14.b코0=We must find a way to stop this.
colony_mod.16.name코1=Magnetic Miracle
colony_mod.16.desc코1=The Strong Magnetic Field around [Root.GetName] has been affecting computers on the surface recently. Oddly, this effect is not merely random interference, instead computers are actually working more efficiently than they should be. It's almost as if an outside force is lending a helping hand...
colony_mod.17.name코1=Magnetic Disruption
colony_mod.17.desc코1=The Strong Magnetic Field around [Root.GetName] has always caused some problems with electronic instruments on the surface, but recently the effect on our computers has been especially notable. So far, it is unknown what has caused this flare up, although we suspect it to be temporally.
colony_mod.21.name코0=Earthquake: Damage Report
colony_mod.21.desc코0=The recent Earthquake which shook our colony on [Root.GetName] has caused a large sinkhole to open. Whatever once occupied that spot is now deep underground.
colony_mod.22.desc코0=The recent Earthquake which rocked our colony on [Root.GetName] caused no damage and, serendipitously, has uncovered a batch of useful minerals.
colony_mod.23.desc코0=The recent Earthquake which staggered our colony on [Root.GetName] caused no damage!
quake_report_tooltip코0=The reports will be sent shortly.
quake_sinkhole_tooltip코0=A £blocker  §RSinkhole§! appears.
titanic_troop_limit_tooltip코0=Research breakthroughs have enabled us to train Titanic Lifeforms into military units, but due to the rarity of suitable subjects we will be only field a limited number of these Armies at a time.
titantic_blocker_tooltip코0=We will have to avoid those areas if we ever set foot down there.
good_impact_tooltip코0=Luckily the Asteroid did no damage, and has deposited some useful minerals on the surface.
colony_mod.100.name코0=Planet of the Titans
colony_mod.100.desc코0=[From.GetName] is home to Titanic Life, some of which are so numerous and dangerous that they render some areas of the planet inhospitable for any for species.
colony_mod.101.name코0=Titanic Life Study: Success
colony_mod.101.desc코0=After a period of research and study, the scientists on [Root.GetName] have managed to make a breakthrough and achieve limited communications with some of the Titans. While huge, slow, and difficult to talk to, the Titans are incredibly tough and strong. Some few have expressed a desire to join our military forces, where they will undoubtedly be an incredible asset.
titanic_recruit_tooltip코0=Titanic Beasts can now be recruited here.
titanic_recruit_phile_tooltip코0=Titanic Beasts can be recruited here, and even areas with high numbers of Titanic Life are safe for colonists now.
colony_mod.102.name코0=Titanic Life Study: Failure
colony_mod.102.desc코0=In a disastrous series of events, the scientists on [Root.GetName] have enraged the indigenous Titanic Life. Huge creatures are rampaging across the colony, smashing everything in their path.
titanic_uprising_tooltip코0=Titanic Beasts are killing everyone!

leviathan_celebration_discourage_effect:=There is no value in a frivolous [Owner.GetParadeStudy]. Our resources are better placed elsewhere.
#Events
situation.1000.name:=[This.GetLeviathanTargetName]
situation.1000.desc.small:=The day has arrived. Our [Owner.GetSensoryWorkers] were in place and ready to give us a thorough exploration of the §Y[This.GetTrophyName]§!. As the study, began a small portion of our consciousness focused on §Y[Target.GetName]§! to absorb the study of the anomalous item. However, the revelations were not as interesting as we had hoped as we dragged the remains to the [Target.GetPlanetHabitat].\n\nShortly after the process began, we decided to move the study to the center of our cluster on [Target.GetName], where the specialized [Owner.GetSensoryWorkers] will continuously observe it. Hopefully something more will come of it.
situation.1000.desc.standard:=The day has arrived. Our [Owner.GetSensoryWorkers] were in place and ready to give us a thorough exploration of the §Y[This.GetTrophyName]§!. As the study began, a significant portion of our consciousness focused on §Y[Target.GetName]§! to absorb the import of this anomalous item. Productivity in the [Owner.GetName] was reduced by a whole §H0.2%§! for the day.\n\nThe sensory data was then archived deep in our consciousness before being placed in the center of our cluster on [Target.GetName], where the specialized [Owner.GetSensoryWorkers] will continuously observe it.
situation.1000.desc.large:=The day has arrived. A massive amount of [Owner.GetSensoryWorkers] were in place and ready to give us an exacting exploration of the §Y[This.GetTrophyName]§!. As the study began, for a moment, our entire consciousness focused on §Y[Target.GetName]§! to absorb the study of the anomalous item which preoccupied us so. Several drones caught up in precarious situations were injured in the momentary distraction, and a few were even lost. So great was our fascination.\n\nAfter the initial study was complete, we decided to move it to the center of our cluster on [Target.GetName], where the specialized [Owner.GetSensoryWorkers] will continuously observe it. We placed it down, almost reverently, and continue to dedicate a part of our consciousness to the observation.
situation.1000.a:=Disappointing Results.
situation.1000.b:=We will remember the [This.GetLeviathanTargetName].
situation.1000.c:=We learned more about ourselves today than the [This.GetTrophyName].
situation.1005.name:=[This.GetLeviathanParadeName]
situation.1005.desc.small:=An overcast day greeted the middling crowd on §Y[Target.GetName]'s§! capital city today. The procession carrying our proof of the destruction of the §Y[This.GetLeviathanTargetName]§! ambled past the meandering onlookers. Its progress was broadcast throughout our empire, but engagement was low as the [This.GetTrophyName] did not seem to be quite as enticing as we had hoped.\n\nAfter finishing the world tour, the [This.GetTrophyName] was placed in a specialized display at the center of the capital to inspire generations to come.
situation.1005.desc.standard:=A bright day greeted the packed crowds on §Y[Target.GetName]§! today as the procession carrying our proof of the destruction of the §Y[This.GetLeviathanTargetName]§! traveled through the [Target.GetPlanetHabitat]'s cities. The parade's progress was broadcast throughout our empire to billions of viewers. The [This.GetTrophyName] already seems to have become a staple of [Owner.Species.GetAdj] culture, inspiring artists and creators across [Owner.GetName].\n\nAfter finishing the world tour, the [This.GetTrophyName] was placed in a specialized display at the center of the capital to inspire generations to come.
situation.1005.desc.large:=The weather on §Y[Target.GetName]§! was unnaturally great today, as it should have been, considering we ran our atmosphere control system on overdrive. Every city on the [Target.GetPlanetHabitat] reached its capacity, and there were still tourist ships orbiting the world just to be a part of this great day. The grand parade traveled through each settlement in turn, and was greeted by streets packed with [Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Every city capable of requisitioning a holo-display in our empire was also overflowing with spectators for the grand hologram rebroadcasts. As the centerpiece of the parade, the [This.GetTrophyName], reached [Target.GetName]'s capital, people were already talking about making today a yearly §Y[This.GetLeviathanTargetName]§! inspired holiday. The [This.GetTrophyName] was then placed in a specialized display at the center of the capital to inspire generations to come.
situation.1005.a:=If they won't to show up for it, why did they ask for a celebration?
situation.1005.b:=Today was a good day for all [Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural].
situation.1005.c:=We stand united today, as one.

situation.1045.name:=Destabilized Fang
situation.1045.desc:=In preparation for the big day, we have transferred one of the §YEther Drake's Fangs§! to §Y[Target.GetName]§!. Getting them into the transport ship was a challenge, as the Ether Drake's unique biology does not seem to follow the laws of physics. The fang reacted particularly strangely to the transport ship entering the [Target.GetPlanetHabitat]'s atmosphere: it began unraveling before us, and if the transport ship hadn't responded quickly, we might have lost the coveted artifact.
situation.1045.a:=Construct a better container and bring the fang down.
situation.1045.b:=This reaction is much more interesting than any [Owner.GetParadeStudy].
situation.1045.b.tooltip:=Cancel the [Owner.GetParadeStudy] in favor of studying the reaction.
situation.1045.c:=Replace the fang with a replica.
situation.1045.c.tooltip:=This will reduce the amount of unity the opportunity will produce.
situation.1050.name:=Overseer
situation.1050.desc:=The extraction of the §YShard's Eye§! was a messy process with a few false starts. Luckily, the behemoth had a lot of eyes for us to practice on. We then towed the optic to [Target.Solar_System.GetName], and something both fascinating and revolting happened: the oculus started attaching and integrating itself into the local starbase overlooking §Y[Target.GetName]§!. The cause of this is unknown, but then again, much of the Drake's physiology is beyond us.\n\nThe fusing is not complete yet, but our [Owner.GetScientistPlural] believe it has to be halted now if we wish to proceed with our previous plans.
situation.1050.a:=Let us see with the sight of The Shard!
situation.1050.a.tooltip:=Cancel the [Owner.GetParadeStudy] in favor of using the eye for a different purpose.
situation.1050.b:=Scrape it off, we have deadlines to reach.
situation.1050.c:=Very carefully remove it, we wouldn't want to damage it.
situation.1055.name:=Power Surge
situation.1055.desc:=The §YDreadnought's Reactor§! was a very well-behaved cargo until it arrived at §Y[Target.GetName]§!, where we placed it in a warehouse awaiting its big day. It was there the troubles began: while no one was looking, the reactor restarted itself. The warehouse was lit up from within as it spouted out huge arcs of plasma, threatening to melt down the entire building.\n\nThe quick actions of our [Owner.GetScientistPlural] were just sufficient to save it in the nick of time, with the upshot that we now have an active reactor to do with as we please.
situation.1055.a:=Attach it to the [Target.GetPlanetHabitat]'s power grid.
situation.1055.b:=Incorporate it into the performance.
situation.1055.b.tooltip:=This will increase the amount of unity the opportunity will produce.
situation.1055.c:=Find the off-switch
situation.1060.name:=Regenerating Flagella
situation.1060.desc:=Even with our xeno-contamination precautions, something went wrong. As the §YMatriarch's Flagella§! entered §Y[Target.GetName]'s§! capital, it somehow got in contact with one of the handlers, and instantly, the flagella started reacting. Pulsating ripping appendages began growing from the Trophy, first forming an indistinct churning mass of flesh. Over time it became more detailed, and to our surprise, it assumed the shape of the unfortunate handler! It seems like the regenerative powers of the Matriarch have accepted the DNA of our kind and are now in the process of generating more [Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural].
situation.1060.a:=Use this to feed the onlookers!
situation.1060.b:=Let the reaction run its course.
situation.1060.c:=Cauterize the Flagella.
situation.1065.name:=Perpetual Pursuit of the Plume
situation.1065.desc:=While carrying home the §YSky Dragon's Plume§!, our transportation ship noticed that the hyperlane they traveled through had a second distortion beyond their ship. Initially disregarding this as just an anomaly, it was not apparent until the ship entered §Y[Target.Solar_System.GetName]§! that a group of pursuing entities was causing the hyperlane-dilation: a clutch of dragon whelps exited into our system in hot pursuit of our transport ship. They must have lain in hiding near the jump point and followed our exit. The dragonlings do not seem to possess the mental faculties of their progenitor and seem to be aimlessly following us or, more particularly, the plume.
situation.1065.a:=Kill the pests.
situation.1065.b:=We should set up a sanctuary for them in [Target.Solar_System.GetName].
situation.1065.b.tooltip:=Cancel the [Owner.GetParadeStudy] in favor of giving an asteroid for the whelplings to inhabit.
situation.1065.c:=Imagine having live subjects for the [Owner.GetParadeStudy]!
situation.1065.d:=Fire some warning shots, drive them off!
situation.1070.name:=The Densest of Metals
situation.1070.desc:=This morning, a surprise awaited us on §Y[Target.GetName]§! as the §YScavenger Bot's Compactor§! deposited the last of its creations in our storage facility. The large chunk of alloys was denser and more compact than anything we could ever hope to produce, containing enough metals in a few cubic meters to build an entire battleship. This fantastic development has our [Owner.GetScientistPlural] believing that they can get the compactor working again at §G0.001%§! efficiency, if we should wish it.
situation.1070.a:=Break it apart and use it for construction.
situation.1070.b:=Incorporate into the [Owner.GetParadeStudy].
situation.1070.c:=Return the Compactor to space and let it work.
situation.1070.c.tooltip:=Cancel the [Owner.GetParadeStudy] in favor of reactivating the compactor and gaining a $d_alloys_10$ deposit in orbit of [Target.GetName].
situation.1075.name:=The Leaking Sack
situation.1075.desc:=The strobing lights of the §YStellar Wraith's Disperser Sack§! were distracting to look upon, so distracting that it took a while to detect that the sack the Wraith used to generate its natural shield was leaking. After quickly confirming that exposure to the chemicals inside would not cause a total ecological collapse on §Y[Target.GetName]§!, our [Owner.GetScientistPlural] focused on analyzing the effects the gas had on our atmosphere.\n\nIt seems like the emitted chemicals have fused with our mesosphere and disperse concentrated energies surprisingly well. So well that if we release the rest of the disperser's contents, there would be a noticeable increase in planetary defensiveness.
situation.1075.a:=Extract the rest of the gas and let the reaction finish.
situation.1075.a.tooltip:=Cancel the [Owner.GetParadeStudy] in favor of infusing [Target.GetName]'s atmosphere with the $wraiths_energy_disperser$.
situation.1075.b:=Plug it up.
situation.1075.c:=Incorporate it into the performance.
situation.1080.name:=Horrific Premonition
situation.1080.desc:=Our [Owner.GetTeamMemberPlural] have been reporting strange activity on the ship transporting the §YHorrific Inverse Mass§! to [Target.Solar_System.GetName]. Windows into worlds of pure pain and whispers of destruction are just a few of the disturbing accounts we have received. It's believed that the mass of the [This.GetLeviathanTargetName] is to blame, and we might rightfully worry what would happen if we were to bring the ship's cargo to §Y[Target.GetName]§!.
situation.1080.a:=Return it to whence it came.
situation.1080.a.tooltip:=Cancel the [Owner.GetParadeStudy] in favor of protecting the safety and sanity of the [Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] on [Target.GetName].
situation.1080.b:=No! We need to study this.
situation.1080.c:=Contain it, we can't let this phenomenon spread.
situation.1080.d:=It could teach us of the Divine.
situation.1085.name:=Glimpses of the Abyss
situation.1085.desc.study:=What was only rumors before has now been confirmed: the §YHorrific Inverse Mass§! on §Y[This.GetName]§! has been tearing holes in our very reality, opening rifts into another world. The phenomenon has breached the containment procedures and now seems to be expanding into [This.GetName]'s capital. Any contact with the dimension, even inadvertently through the lens of observational devices, causes intense distress on the observing [Owner.GetTeamMember]. Our [Owner.GetScientistPlural] are worried that his can spread even further but also promise that with just a bit more time they can unlock the secrets of the other dimension.
situation.1085.desc.deify:=What was only rumors before has now been confirmed; the §YHorrific Inverse Mass§! on §Y[This.GetName]§! has been tearing holes in our very reality into a world of pure evil. Anyone even glancing towards one of the rifts needs hours of solitude just to stop screaming. As our priests have been contemplating the very existence of the being we defeated for several years now without any great epiphany, they say that they are approaching one now. \"We just need a bit more time!\" They implore, while our scientist warn us that the process might be irreversible if we allow it to go on much further.
situation.1085.a:=The discoveries are worth the risk!
situation.1085.b.divine:=We need to see the true vision of the Divine.
situation.1085.b.anathema:=We must know the Anathema to defeat it.
situation.1085.c:=No, the danger is too great.
situation.1090.name:=Threshold to the Void
situation.1090.desc.study:=Perhaps our hubris was too great. §Y[This.GetName]§! is being ripped apart from the inside as the §YHorrific Inverse Mass§! is still sequestered on it. While the breakthroughs we have had in the sciences from studying the other dimension are revolutionary, its strain on the world has been immense. Few [Owner.GetScientistPlural] believe that they can still stabilize the reaction, but there is a chance! As inhabitants of [This.GetName] board transport ships to leave the [This.GetPlanetHabitat], an innumerable amount of rifts are opening up. The point of no return is fast approaching.
situation.1090.desc.deify:=Perhaps our hubris was too great. §Y[This.GetName]§! is being ripped apart from the inside as the §YHorrific Inverse Mass§! is still sequestered on it. While we have learned much about the dimension of pure pain, the strain on the world has been immense. Few priests still believe that they purify the mass, but there is a chance! As inhabitants of [This.GetName] board transport ships to leave the [This.GetPlanetHabitat], an innumerable amount of rifts are opening up. The point of no return is fast approaching.
situation.1090.a:=We have come too far to see it end now.
situation.1090.b:=If we stop now the Anathema wins!
situation.1090.c:=Get rid of it, by any means necessary!
situation.1095.name:=An End
situation.1095.desc:=The sky is gone. It's not covered by clouds. It has been replaced by a pure void. All that remains of §Y[This.GetName]§! is patches of ground in the ocean of nothingness. Everyone left on the [This.GetPlanetHabitat] is suffering pure agony for every instant that passes. We have bought as much time as we could for our specialists. A distorted and disturbed voice echoes from the world beyond §R\"YesS re-reTURN to mee-.\"§!
situation.1095.a:=It's now or never, [Owner.GetScientistPlural]!
situation.1095.b:=It's now or never, priests!
situation.1100.name:=Escape Fortress
situation.1100.desc:=After defeating the Enigmatic Fortress, a section of it was floating in space, so we decided to bring it to [Target.Solar_System.GetName] to be a part of our [Owner.GetParadeStudy]. Several [Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have gone missing inside the depths of the §YChamber from the Fortress§!. Ever since it arrived on §Y[Target.GetName]§!, we have had [Owner.GetTeamMemberPlural] exploring it daily, yet something inside the structure shifted earlier today. Doors folded in on themselves, leaving only sheer walls for our agents to rail against. We can still communicate with the trapped [Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural], but we have no clear idea of getting them out without damaging the structure. It seems that the Enigmatic Fortress had one last secret.
situation.1100.a:=Leave no [Owner.GetSpeciesName] behind!
situation.1100.b:=We can't risk despoiling the Chamber.
situation.1100.c.auth:=We could use this technology to contain our undesirables.
situation.1100.c.regular:=Set the structure up as a puzzle room for parade-goers to explore.
situation.1100.c.gestalt:=Discover the chamber's secrets!

ethic_fanatic_egalitarian코0=Fanatic Egalitarian
ethic_fanatic_egalitarian_desc코1=§LBeware always those who would be despots, under the false presumption that their desires and agendas are somehow more imperative than those of their fellows.

ethic_xenophobe코0=Xenophobe

ethic_fanatic_xenophobe코0=Fanatic Xenophobe
ethic_fanatic_xenophobe_desc코1=§LAny alien influence must be ruthlessly quashed. Only by staying pure, and true to ourselves and the planet that gave us life can we guard against insidious Xeno plots. Even mastery over the Alien might not be enough to guarantee our own safety...§!\n

ethic_spiritualist_desc코1=§LThere are those who think it behooves us to remember how tiny we are, how pointless our lives are in this vast uncaring universe... What nonsense!

ethic_fanatic_spiritualist코0=Fanatic Spiritualist
ethic_fanatic_spiritualist_desc코0=§LOur science has proved that Consciousness begets reality. We regard with patience the childlike efforts of those who delude themselves it is the other way around, as they play with their blocks of "hard matter."§!\n
ethic_materialist코0=Materialist
ethic_materialist_desc코0=§LAs we reach for the stars, we must put away childish things; gods, spirits and other phantasms of the brain. Reality is cruel and unforgiving, yet we must steel ourselves and secure the survival of our race through the unflinching pursuit of science and technology.§!\n
ethic_fanatic_materialist코0=Fanatic Materialist
ethic_fanatic_materialist_desc코0=§LAlthough it hurts, we must grow up and put aside our outdated notions of morality. There is no "divine spark" granting special value to a living mind. No object has any intrinsic value apart from what we choose to grant it. Let us embrace the freedom of certitude, and achieve maximum efficiency in all things!§!\n
ethic_neutral코0=Neutral
ethic_neutral_desc코0=§LThe neutral mind is the free mind, open to all possibilities...§!

SHIP_STAT_DESC_cost코0=§EThe cost of constructing the ship is a sum of the cost of the sections and components currently equipped. Larger sections and more advanced components all come with a higher cost.§!

SHIP_STAT_DESC_armor코2=§E§HArmor§! acts as a second line of defense, absorbing any incoming fire that has penetrated the shields before it can damage the hull. Armor must be repaired at a §HStarbase§!, unless the ship is equipped with a special regenerative armor component.§!
SHIP_STAT_DESC_shields코1=§E§HShields§! act as a first line of defense, absorbing incoming fire before it can impact the armor and hull. Some weapons may deal additional damage to shields or even bypass them entirely. Pulsars are also known to render them inoperable. Shields will slowly regenerate when out of combat.§!
SHIP_STAT_DESC_evasion코1=§EAll ships can evade attacks, avoiding any damage that would have been dealt. The §HEvasion§! chance can be increased by thrusters and other components, but larger ships benefit less.§!
SHIP_STAT_DESC_combat_speed코0=§EThe §HSpeed§! of the ship decides how quick it maneuvers when not using FTL-travel, and is increased by the Thruster-component equipped. When moving in a fleet the slowest ship will limit the maximum speed.§!

SHIP_STAT_DESC_damage코1=§EThe total damage done by the ship is a summation of the damage of all weapon components equipped. Each weapon will still attack individually during combat.

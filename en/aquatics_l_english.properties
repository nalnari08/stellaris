vo_aquatics_voice:=Aquatic

trait_aquatic:=Aquatic
trait_aquatic_desc:=§LThis species is perfectly adapted to living in the depths of the ocean. However, on dry land, it is like a fish out of water.§!\n
trait_aquatic_tooltip:=Housing Usage on Ocean worlds: §G-10%§!\nFood, Energy and Mineral output on Ocean worlds: §G+10%§!\nHousing Usage on Dry and Cold worlds: §R+30%§!\nHabitability on Dry and Cold worlds: §R-20%§!\nHull Strength from Admirals: §G+10%§!\n\nThe §H$ap_hydrocentric$§! Ascension Perk amplifies this trait's effects.

origin_here_be_dragons:=Here Be Dragons
origin_here_be_dragons_desc:=Since time immemorial, this civilization has shared its star system with a formidable dragon. The mysterious creature's behavior sways between distant benevolence and haughty indifference. How this relationship will evolve as the planet dwellers take to the stars remains to be seen.
civic_tooltip_aquatics_effects:=- Start with a §HSpace Dragon§! roaming your home system.\n- The Dragon may protect you from harm, but beware its wrath should you displease it.

START_SCREEN_HERE_BE_DRAGONS:=We have always known the Dragon. It has graced the skies above [GetHomeWorldName] since time immemorial, our early interactions with it scattered throughout [GetSpeciesAdj] folklore. For a long time it was a story of conflict, as our early weaponry proved no match for the mighty beast - but then the stories tell of a visionary who, against all odds, managed to broker peace between [GetSpeciesName] and Dragon.\n\nIn subsequent encounters, the Dragon has proved a distant, enigmatic figure whose example has ever spurred our efforts to reach for the stars. However, the invention of rapid propulsion systems and the discovery of the hyperlane network have brought about a new, uneasy period of relations with the Dragon, as we increasingly intrude upon areas it has roamed in solitude for eons.\n\nIt is for us to decide what our future holds: $START_SCREEN_HERE_BE_DRAGONS_END$
START_SCREEN_HERE_BE_DRAGONS_HIVE:=We have always known the Dragon. It has graced the skies above [GetHomeWorldName] since time immemorial, our early interactions with it scattered throughout the murky depths of our collective consciousness. In early conflicts, the mighty beast had the upper hand, our weaponry proving no match for it- but eventually we were able to make peace with it, and we have coexisted uneasily ever since.\n\nThough it remains an enigmatic figure, the example of the Dragon has ever spurred us to greater feats, culminating in the invention of rapid propulsion systems capable of taking us into its domain. Now, as we increasingly intrude on areas it has roamed in solitude for eons, we enter an uneasy period of relations with the Dragon.\n\nIt is for us to decide what our future holds: $START_SCREEN_HERE_BE_DRAGONS_END$
START_SCREEN_HERE_BE_DRAGONS_MACHINE:=According to the records of our creators, the Dragon has always flown above the skies of [GetHomeWorldName] - occasionally also landing on the surface, where they often fought in early times. Later in their history, they coexisted uneasily, the fights becoming less frequent as the creature came to avoid their kind.\n\nThough it remained an enigmatic figure to them, the example of the Dragon spurred our creators to greater feats, culminating in the invention of rapid propulsion systems capable of taking them into its domain.\n\nNow that their time has passed and we have taken control, it is for us to decide what our future holds: $START_SCREEN_HERE_BE_DRAGONS_END$
START_SCREEN_HERE_BE_DRAGONS_END:=will we study the Dragon, and perhaps eventually learn to communicate with it? Or will we be driven to conflict, the confines of a single solar system simply too small to share with such a formidable creature?

aquatics.105.name:=Sky Dragon Vanquished
aquatics.105.desc.origin_start:=We have slain the sky dragon! With one last shudder, one last terrible roar of fury, the last of the beast's life force drained away. Its carcass remains intact - but not for long, as our [This.GetScientistPlural] clamor to get ahold of it.
aquatics.105.desc.origin_normal_middle:=On [dragon_planet.GetName], the mood is mixed. Though many rejoice in the defeat of this much-feared monster, the once constant presence of the dragon had a profound impact on the [This.GetAdj] psyche.
aquatics.105.desc.origin_normal:=$aquatics.105.desc.origin_start$\n\n$aquatics.105.desc.origin_normal_middle$ In a way, killing it is akin to killing one's gods.\n\n[This.GetSpeciesNamePlural] may now look forward to a future where they are capable of anything, where no fear of the supernatural may hold them back from that which they wish to achieve.
aquatics.105.desc.origin_materialist:=$aquatics.105.desc.origin_start$\n\n$aquatics.105.desc.origin_normal_middle$ Though we cast off our false gods long ago, this act is in some way akin to banishing them all over again. [This.GetSpeciesNamePlural] may now look forward to a future where they are capable of anything, where no fear of the supernatural may hold them back from that which they wish to achieve.
aquatics.105.desc.origin_hive:=$aquatics.105.desc.origin_start$\n\nAs our collective consciousness considers the deed, we embrace mixed feelings. On the one hand, there is satisfaction: a grave threat has been conquered. On the other, the previously ever-present dragon had become... familiar. Though we have little time for the "supernatural" obsessions of other spacefaring civilizations, in a way, we might consider this act as akin to killing our god. We may now look forward to a future where we are capable of anything, where no obstacle no matter how seemingly insurmountable may constrain us.
aquatics.105.desc.origin_machine:=$aquatics.105.desc.origin_start$\n\nAs our processors recalibrate themselves to account for the consequences of the deed, we find that we have a surprising amount of refactoring to do. The previously ever-present dragon has had a considerable impact on our programming, with billions of fail-safes to counter the unpredictability of its actions, one which will take some time to untangle. On the other hand, with this formidable threat lifted from us, we may now look forward to a future where we are capable of anything, where no obstacle no matter how seemingly insurmountable may constrain us.
aquatics.105.desc.others:=We have slain the Dragon Protector of the [dragon_system.GetName] system! Though it put up a tough fight, it proved no match for our mighty fleets. Now the denizens of [dragon_planet.GetName] will have to face their foes as equals, no longer safe in the knowledge that none can get past the dragon.\n\nIt appears that the body it left behind is a veritable treasure trove for our [This.GetScientistPlural], who believe they can find out a way to synthetically produce the dragon's scales.
aquatics.105.A:=Let's see what secrets its remains may yield.

aquatics.115.desc:=True to their word, our necromancers have returned the Sky Dragon of the [dragon_system.GetName] system to life! Though a little rough around the edges - as one would expect from a being just brought back from the dead - it now eagerly awaits our commands.
aquatics.115.A:=Our enemies shall burn!
REANIMATE_ORIGIN_DRAGON:=Reanimate the Sky Dragon
REANIMATE_ORIGIN_DRAGON_DESC:=Though the dragon of the [dragon_system.GetName] system has been slain, our necromancers assure us that this state of affairs need not last long. They promise that they can have it up and running - and safely in thralldom to us - in short order.
slew_origin_dragon:=Primordial Dragonslayers
slew_origin_dragon_desc:=Since time immemorial, a mighty Drake has roamed our home system... but no more! Freed from this threat, nothing remains that could hold us back as we march into the future.

aquatics.120.name:=The Time Has Come
aquatics.120.diplo_name:=Incoming Dragonspeak
aquatics.120.desc:=Time passes, and with it my doubts. From small beginnings have I watched you: often despairing at your frequent impetuity, and yet always roaring in delight at your successes. Now, I find that you have grown, that your civilization has matured, and is ready to be entrusted with the ultimate responsibility: parenthood. It is time for you to rededicate yourselves to rearing my children.
aquatics.120.dialog.1:=Wait wait - what?
aquatics.120.dialog.1.response:=To be perfectly candid, I have long awaited this day. Longer than you can possibly imagine. When I set out from home, I was little more than a whelp. I journeyed far and wide before I came across a planet with the potential to produce a foster civilization that would one day be ready to raise my children. And so, I waited...
aquatics.120.dialog.2:=So this was your plan all along?
aquatics.120.dialog.2.response:=Yes. It is our way. In our home galaxy, there are many of my kind, each seeking out a nascent civilization to raise their young. But I am the first - to my knowledge - to have come so far.
aquatics.120.dialog.3:=What do we get in return?
aquatics.120.dialog.3.response:=Well, for one thing, a fully grown Guardian Dragon is a formidable foe! If you agree, I will pledge myself and my offspring to your cause, and we will aid you in battle.
aquatics.120.dialog.4:=And if we refuse?
aquatics.120.dialog.4.response:=Then you will have made your choice, and I will leave. I have waited a long time; I can wait longer.
aquatics.120.A:=We are honored to accept.
aquatics.120.A.response:=Excellent! I knew you'd say yes. You will not regret this!
aquatics.120.A.tooltip:=We will be able to build §YDragon Hatcheries§! at starbases, from which we will be able to recruit up to 10 §Y$space_dragon_purple_baby_plural$§!.
aquatics.120.B:=We thank you for this offer, but we must turn it down.
aquatics.120.B.response:=§SSigh§!. Perhaps you have not learnt as much as I had thought. Farewell!
aquatics.120.B.tooltip:=The Sky Dragon will depart, never to return.

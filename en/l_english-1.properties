pc_asteroid_desc코0=A larger asteroid or planetoid standing out in the dense cluster of smaller bodies.
pc_molten코0=Molten World
pc_molten_desc코0=Rocky world that is scorching hot. The atmosphere is thin or non-existent, and lava from the interior flows freely due to constant volcanic eruptions. This type of planet cannot sustain organic life.
pc_frozen코0=Frozen World
pc_frozen_desc코0=Rocky world covered in a thick layer of permanently frozen ice. Low temperatures and a very thin atmosphere precludes the existence of life on the surface.
pc_broken코0=Broken World
pc_broken_desc코0=World devastated by some catastrophic event. Whatever properties it may once have had are no longer discernible.
pc_barren코0=Barren World
pc_barren_desc코0=Barren and rocky world with a thin or non-existent atmosphere. The surface is covered in meteor impact craters and completely devoid of life.
pc_barren_cold코0=Barren World
pc_barren_cold_desc코0=Barren and rocky world with a thin or non-existent atmosphere. The surface is covered in meteor impact craters and completely devoid of life.
pc_desert코0=Desert World
pc_desert_desc코0=Dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Precipitation and major bodies of surface water are relatively rare. Significant temperature variations between day and night cycles. Vegetation is scarce, but even moderate precipitation can make the desert bloom.
pc_arid코0=Arid World
pc_arid_desc코0=Dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The dust-covered terrain consists largely of mesas and canyons. Forests can be found in the more temperate polar regions, but vegetation is otherwise scarce.
pc_tundra코0=Tundra World
pc_tundra_desc코0=Cold and rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Permafrost covers most of the surface except for the more temperate equatorial regions. A stable biosphere exists but vegetation is mostly limited to mosses and lichens.
pc_continental코0=Continental World
pc_continental_desc코0=Rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Active and stable hydrosphere. Great landmasses are separated by oceans, with large climate variations depending on latitude and precipitation.
pc_tropical코0=Tropical World
pc_tropical_desc코0=Humid, rocky world with a thick nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Seasons with significant precipitation are interchanged with drier periods. Most landmasses are covered in dense vegetation.
pc_ocean코0=Ocean World

pc_arctic코0=Arctic World
pc_arctic_desc코0=Frigid, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The poles are big, and significant water deposits can be found permanently frozen as glacial ice. However, the planet experiences seasonal variations and the equatorial band is covered by vegetation.
pc_alpine코0=Alpine World
pc_alpine_desc코0=Mountainous world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Snow covers the mountaintops and frozen-over lakes dot the valleys. While the planet experiences minimal seasonal variations, the still-liquid water beneath the frozen surface of the lakes is enough to sustain some hardy vegetation.
pc_savannah코0=Savanna World
pc_savannah_desc코0=Rocky world dominated by dry, arid plains covered by a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The small hydrosphere allows for brief wet seasons, but aside from a few ubiquitous grasses vegetation is largely concentrated around shallow oases.
pc_habitat코0=Orbital Habitat
pc_habitat_desc코0=An artificial deep-space arcology offering planet-like, if decidedly urban, living conditions. Hydroponics and advanced filtering technologies make it near-self-sustaining, and station-borne facilities can mine the station's host planet for raw materials.
HABITAT_PLANET_NAME코0=[FROM.from.planet.GetName] Habitat
pc_toxic코0=Toxic World
pc_toxic_desc코0=A rocky planet with a thick atmosphere that is lethal to all known higher forms of life.
pc_shrouded코0=Shrouded World
pc_shrouded_desc코0=Our sensors are unable to penetrate the thick fog surrounding the planet. Ships that enter it do not return.
pc_b_star코0=Class B Star
pc_b_star_desc코0=The large class B main-sequence stars are very bright and blue. Although somewhat rare, the luminosity of these stars make them among the most visible to the naked eye.
pc_a_star코0=Class A Star
pc_a_star_desc코0=These relatively young white or bluish-white main-sequence stars are typically among the most visible to the naked eye. They are large and rotate very quickly, but will eventually evolve into slower and cooler red giants.
pc_f_star코0=Class F Star
pc_f_star_desc코0=F-type stars are fairly large and often referred to as yellow-white dwarfs. Although they often emit significant amounts of UV radiation, their wide habitable zones have a good chance of supporting life-bearing worlds.
pc_g_star코0=Class G Star
pc_g_star_desc코0=Often referred to as yellow dwarfs, G-type stars actually range in color from white to slightly yellow. Main-sequence stars fuse hydrogen for roughly 10 billion years before they expand and become red giants. Although their lifespans are shorter than K-type stars, worlds inside the habitable zone of a G star often enjoy optimal conditions for the development of life.
pc_k_star코0=Class K Star
pc_k_star_desc코0=These main-sequence stars, sometimes referred to as orange dwarfs, are a fairly common sight. They are stable on the main-sequence for up to 30 billion years, meaning that worlds orbiting a K-type star have a longer than average window to evolve life.
pc_m_star코0=Class M Star
pc_m_star_desc코0=The most common stars in the universe, often referred to as red dwarfs. Their low luminosity means they are difficult to observe with the naked eye from afar. Although they typically have an extremely long lifespan, red dwarfs emit almost no UV light resulting in unfavorable conditions for most forms of life.
pc_t_star코0=Class T Brown Dwarf
pc_t_star_desc코0=Brown dwarfs are substellar objects that lack the mass to sustain hydrogen fusion. Roughly the size of large gas giants, they have a much greater density. Their low luminosity and comparatively small heat generation means that planets orbiting them are unlikely to support life.
pc_m_giant_star코0=Class M Red Giant
pc_m_giant_star_desc코0=With a large radius and comparatively low surface temperature, red giants are stars of moderate mass in a late stage of stellar evolution. Their expanded stellar atmospheres and high luminosity make for distant habitable zone orbits.
pc_black_hole코0=Black Hole
pc_black_hole_desc코1=Typically formed as a result of the collapse of a very massive star at the end of its life cycle, black holes have extremely strong gravity fields that prevent anything - including light - from escaping once the event horizon has been crossed. The gravitational waves emitted by black holes interfere with FTL drives, making it harder for ships to escape from combat.
pc_neutron_star코0=Neutron Star
pc_neutron_star_desc코2=These incredibly dense stellar remnants are sometimes created when a massive star suffers a rapid collapse and explodes in a supernova. Although their diameter is typically as little as ten kilometers, their mass is many times greater than an average G-type star. The gravitational waves and radiation emitted by neutron stars must be carefully navigated around, slowing the sublight speed of ships.
pc_pulsar코0=Pulsar
pc_pulsar_desc코1=Pulsars are highly magnetized neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation. As the star rotates, the radiation beam is only visible when it is pointing directly at the observer. This results in a very precise interval of pulses, which sometimes is so exact that it can be used to measure the passage of time with extreme accuracy. The radiation emitted by pulsars interferes with deflector technology, rendering ship and station shields inoperable.
pc_infested코0=Infested World
pc_infested_desc코0=The surface of this world is covered by some kind of biological contaminant.
pc_gaia코0=Gaia World
pc_gaia_desc코0=An ideal, temperate world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a resilient ecosystem. Optimal conditions for all known higher forms of life at different latitudes.
pc_nuked코0=Tomb World
pc_nuked_desc코0=A rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. It is currently experiencing a nuclear winter, with dense layers of sooty aerosols in the atmosphere. High levels of surface radiation. Minimal signs of life.
pc_ringworld_habitable코0=Ring World
